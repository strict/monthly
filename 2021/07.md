# 2021.07 - Making JavaScript run fast on WebAssembly

### Making JavaScript run fast on WebAssembly

JavaScript in the browser runs many times faster than it did two decades ago. And that happened because the browser vendors spent that time working on intensive performance optimizations. Today, we’re starting work on optimizing JavaScript performance for entirely different environments, where different rules apply. And this is possible because of WebAssembly.

### Benchmarking JavaScript Memory Usage

One of the things that is so challenging about the conversation around memory usage on the web right now is the sheer number of unknowns. We haven't historically had ways of accurately determining how much memory a page is using in the real world, which means we haven't been able to draw a connection between memory usage and business or user engagement metrics to be able to determine what "good" looks like. So at the moment, we have no idea how problematic memory is, other than anecdotal stories that crop up here and there.

### Towards a better responsiveness metric

On the Chrome Speed Metrics team, we're working on deepening our understanding of how quickly web pages respond to user input. We'd like to share some ideas for improving responsiveness metrics and hear your feedback.

### 架构中的矛盾和权衡

我们在讨论架构的过程中，总会陷入一些矛盾，这些经典的矛盾成了关于架构无尽争论的源头。这些矛盾往往是我们分析架构方法的关键所在。在现实中，企业采用微服务架构的主要动机往往是因为团队过大，以至于无法让数十个、百个人同时在一个项目上工作。这个时候会带来另外问题，如何让这些分布式的系统合适的集成起来成了另外一个问题。这时候，使用微服务架构是为了解决一个矛盾：大型团队超过管理容量和并行开发之间的矛盾。当我们在讨论是否需要微服务时，需要关注时候当前有类似的矛盾存在。

### 阿里跨端技术演进中的实践与思考

一般来说，跨端技术有 4 类场景，分别是跨设备平台（跨 Web 端和手机端）、跨操作系统（如跨安卓和 iOS）、跨 App 以及跨渲染容器。本篇文章将重点围绕移动领域的跨端技术进行深入探讨。

### Introducing chrome.scripting

Manifest V3 introduces a number of changes to Chrome's extension platform. In this post, we'll be exploring the motivations and changes introduced by one of the more notable changes: the introduction of the chrome.scripting API.

### On the Diverse And Fantastical Shapes of Testing

There's been a recent resurgence on twitter and the like about how teams should divide up their testing efforts. In particular, Tim Bray argues compellingly in favor of taking automated testing seriously. Anyone familiar with my writing will know that I'm very much in agreement with him.

### How Much Testing is Enough?

A familiar question every software developer and team grapples with is, “How much testing is enough to qualify a software release?” A lot depends on the type of software, its purpose, and its target audience. One would expect a far more rigorous approach to testing commercial search engne than a simple smartphone flashlight application. Yet no matter what the application, the question of how much testing is sufficient can be hard to answer in definitive terms. A better approach is to provide considerations or rules of thumb that can be used to define a qualification process and testing strategy best suited for the case at hand.

### 业务中的前端组件化体系

在业务开发过程中，我们总是会期望某些功能一定程度的复用。很基础的那些元素，比如按钮，输入框，它们的使用方式都已经被大部分人熟知，但是一旦某块功能复杂起来，成为一种“业务组件”的时候，就会陷入一些很奇怪的境况，最初是期望抽出来的这块组件能有比较好的复用性，但是，可能当另外一个业务想要复用它的时候，往往遇到很多问题。在一个业务体系中，组件化到底应该如何去做？本文试图围绕这个主题，给出一些可能的解决思路。

### 5 Advanced React Patterns

Like every React developer, you’ve probably already asked yourself one of the following questions: How do I build a reusable component to fit with different use cases? How do I build a component with a simple API, making it easy to use? How do I build an extensible component in terms of UI and functionality? These recurring questions led to some advanced patterns throughout the React community.

### Why we need to stop using React

Before we even get started I can already hear you pounding away at your keyboards writing your angry response. I would ask that you read my full explanation before going off at me in the comments. I really want to emphasize that I’m not trying to attack you personally because you use React or like React. However, what I am trying to say is that I think that React leaves a lot to be desired. What I want to do is explore the pain points and detail why I think React is an overall flawed library.

### New Suspense SSR Architecture in React 18

React 18 will include architectural improvements to React server-side rendering (SSR) performance. These improvements are substantial and are the culmination of several years of work. Most of these improvements are behind-the-scenes, but there are some opt-in mechanisms you’ll want to be aware of, especially if you don’t use a framework.

### Containers

In this issue, we don’t explore any nautical misadventures, but we do examine the container ecosystem’s scope, scale, and panoramic possibilities. Among other things, you’ll find practical considerations around containerization, as in Nočnica Fee’s primer on core container technologies and their use cases and Liz Rice’s discussion of container security; an interview with Kubernetes co-creator Joe Beda; and some grounding perspective from Tramale Turner on how sometimes good leadership can be the best container migration strategy of all.

### The Document Culture of Amazon

In my time at Amazon, I’ve observed the way we use documents is incredibly unique. A lot has been written about the six-pager and PR/FAQ so I’m not going focus on document formats, but I wanted to share how our process benefits from document-based meetings. I also have identified some areas for improvement if you are looking to adopt document-based meetings for your workplace.

### Why We Need to Rethink the Computer ‘Desktop’ as a Concept

The long-lived “desktop” operating system has been with us for almost 40 years. Although some of the mechanics have proven remarkably durable, contemporary computer usage is very different from the context these were born in, and it’s time to do some rethinking. I’m going to outline the original idea, illustrate some changes in computer use, and suggest some new ways of thinking.

### 6 Product Frameworks From the Inventor of the iPod, iPhone & Nest

Tony Fadell is the legendary inventor of the iPod, co-inventor with Steve Jobs of the iPhone, and Founder of Nest. Now he is the Principal at Future Shape, an investment and advisory firm coaching over 200+ startups. There’s almost an infinity of things to learn from Tony, but what we most wanted to uncover are his product frameworks and first principles for design.

### Epic Games 千亿美金之路（下篇）：堡垒之夜

Epic Games 是全球游戏行业中唯一一家既打造了全球爆款游戏，也研发了顶级游戏引擎，并运营了过亿用户的游戏商城的公司；就像苹果在消费电子行业打通了硬件、软件和服务，Epic Games 有能力在未来重新塑造全球游戏生态，成为千亿美元的公司。目前 Epic 的 secondary 股权转让估值已超过400亿美元，与市值 6,000 亿美元到 1.4 万亿美元的 Facebook、亚马逊、苹果、微软和谷歌相比，估值并不高。然而，Epic Games 有潜力成为世界上最大、最有影响力的科技公司之一，并且越来越有可能成为社会数字化未来的中心。

### How to Work Hard

It might not seem there's much to learn about how to work hard. Anyone who's been to school knows what it entails, even if they chose not to. There are 12 year olds who work amazingly hard. And yet when I ask if I know more about working hard now than when I was in school, the answer is definitely yes. One thing I know is that if you want to do great things, you'll have to work very hard. I wasn't sure of that as a kid. Schoolwork varied in difficulty; one didn't always have to work super hard to do well. And some of the things famous adults did, they seemed to do almost effortlessly. Was there, perhaps, some way to evade hard work through sheer brilliance? Now I know the answer to that question. There isn't.
