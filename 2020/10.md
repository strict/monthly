### The New Mindset for Product-Market Fit

It’s well known that product-market fit is the absolute prerequisite to sustainable growth. It’s pointless to try to grow without a great offering that you’ve already proven that people want, need, and love. But less known is an even earlier and equally mission-critical step. One that can save you months and millions. Before you can find product-market fit, you need to first define your product’s promise. I call this finding your product-promise-market fit. And it doesn’t require a single line of code.

### Beautiful Intelligence

In Microsoft 365, we’re blending art and science to create a library of high-quality content that leverages our powerful AI. From creating original work in-house to commissioning designs from artists worldwide, we’ll be rolling out a curated array of new illustrations, looping videos, photography, fonts, animations, stickers, and much more, beginning primarily within Office.

### 低代码，要怎么低？和低代码有关的 10 个问题

或许是因为 Mendix 和 Outsystems 的收购及融资，还有 Gartner/Forrester 的鼓吹（Gartner 甚至预测 4 年后低代码开发会占应用开发的 65% 以上，你敢信？），这两年低代码忽然开始受到关注，不少公司在开发这方面的产品，我们也将 amis 开源项目的介绍改成了「前端低代码框架」，并推出了包含前后端的低代码平台「爱速搭」，本文将谈谈我对低代码的理解，尝试回答这个 10 问题：

- 低代码是什么？
- 之前是否有低代码平台？它们是怎么做的？
- 低代码究竟能解决什么问题？
- 低代码平台适合用在什么地方？
- 低代码平台会带来什么新问题？
- 低代码平台的难点在哪？
- 前端如何低代码？
- 后端如何低代码？
- 低代码平台是否会大量取代研发？
- 未来会怎样？

### Towards principled reactive UI

This is a followup to my post about a year ago, Towards a unified theory of reactive UI. It is a deeper exploration of the question: “what is the best way to express reactive UI in Rust?” To focus the inquiry, I will start by listing some goals. Each goal will be presented primarily as a way to introduce design decisions made by existing reactive systems, and filter the ones that seem most promising as sources and inspiration. Then I will go into deeper into three principles, which I feel are critically important in any reactive UI framework: whether to use “observable objects,” how to express the mutation of the render object tree (or trees in general), and the notion of stable identity of nodes in that tree.

### 浅析鸿蒙 JavaScript GUI 技术栈

众所周知，刚刚开源的「鸿蒙 2.0」以 JavaScript 作为 IoT 应用开发的框架语言。这标志着继 SpaceX 上天之后，JavaScript 再一次蹭到了新闻联播级的热点。这么好的机会，只拿来阴阳怪气实在太可惜了。作为科普，这篇文章不会拿着放大镜找出代码中的槽点来吹毛求疵，而是希望通俗地讲清楚它所支持的 GUI 到底是怎么一回事。

### 外卖客户端容器化架构的演进

好的架构要不断演变，进而去适应业务的发展。美团在移动端上的架构，也经历了组件化、平台化、RN混合化，到现在开始向容器化变迁。容器化架构充分地利用了现在的跨端技术，将动态化的能力最大化地赋予了业务。作为美团最为重要的业务之一，美团外卖移动端的架构演进是怎样的呢？本文将为你揭开背后的思考、技术细节以及实践。

### Under Deconstruction: The State of Shopify’s Monolith

Ruby on Rails is a great framework for rapidly building beautiful web applications that users and developers love. But if an application is successful, there’s usually continued investment, resulting in additional features and increased overall system complexity. Shopify’s core monolith has over 2.8 million lines of Ruby code and 500,000 commits. Rails doesn’t provide patterns or tooling for managing the inherent complexity and adding features in a structured, well-bounded way. That’s why, over three years ago, Shopify founded a team to investigate how to make our Rails monoliths more modular. The goal was to help us scale towards ever increasing system capabilities and complexity by creating smaller, independent units of code we called components.

### 字节研发设施下的 Git 工作流

字节跳动 Git 仓库有效的 CR (Code Review) 覆盖率 70%，仍有提升空间，通过调研，团队中又以 GitHub Flow 模式居多。随着字节研发效能建设愈发完善，GitHub Flow 已无法充分利用研发设施进行提效并保障工程质量，很多团队均意识到这点并着手建设流程规范。本文通过介绍业界 Git 工作流和公司研发设施现状，力求从仓库形态、部署流程等多角度进行分析，给出一些制定工作流规范的建议。

### I was wrong. CRDTs are the future

I saw Martin Kleppmann’s talk a few weeks ago about his approach to realtime editing with CRDTs, and I felt a deep sense of despair. Maybe all the work I’ve been doing for the past decade won’t be part of the future after all, because Martin’s work will supersede it. Its really good.

### 「划线高亮」和「插入笔记」—— 不止是前端知识点

从「划线高亮」并「插入笔记」这个需求，我们提炼出了一连串前端知识点，同时分析了实施过程当中的困难和解决方案。这些内容涉及到 DOM、BOM 等基本知识，也涉及到编程领域中不可或缺的 AST、编译原理的皮毛，并延伸出现代前端开发所依赖的 Babel 以及框架 Vue 的实现原理。前端开发的护城河之一就是精细化交互实现，前端开发的开疆扩土也依赖于更低层的编程普适原理，希望这篇长文能对大家有所启发。

### Intuitive Design? No Such Thing!

“Intuitive design” is one of those overused phrases that we as designers hear all too often from stakeholders and their requirements. This article explores what intuitive design actually means, why it doesn’t make sense, how we can better approach design solutions, and what the future of interfaces might look like. It is aimed at user experience designers and anyone interested exploring these concepts in greater detail.

### The Unsuspecting Beauty & Complexity of Web Forms

Forms are part of a bigger picture at Slack: a massive pipeline that brings in sales, marketing, customer support, and engineering all under one umbrella. Together, we’ll explore the must-add features Slack uses to build web forms that generate leads for successful deals and reflect on the impact they’ve had.

### Don't Compare Averages

Using only the averages to compare groups of numbers hides many insights. In business meetings, it's common to compare groups of numbers by comparing their averages. But doing so often hides important information in the distribution of the numbers in those groups. There are a number of data visualizations that shine a light on this information. These include strip charts, histograms, density plots, box plots, and violin plots. These are easy to produce with freely available software, working on groups as small as a dozen, or as large as thousands.

### Analytics at Netflix: Who We Are and What We Do

Across nearly every industry, there is recognition that data analytics is key to driving informed business decision-making. But there is far less agreement on what that term “data analytics” actually means — or what to call the people responsible for the work. Even within Netflix, we have many groups that do some form of data analysis, including business strategy and consumer insights. But here we are talking about Netflix’s Data Science and Engineering group, which specializes in analytics at scale. The group has technical, engineering-oriented roles that fall under two broad category titles: “Analytics Engineers” and “Visualization Engineers.” In this post, we refer to these two titles collectively as the “analytics role.” These professionals come from a wide range of backgrounds and bring different skills to their work, while sharing a common drive to generate and scale business impact through data.

### Complexity Scientist Beats Traffic Jams Through Adaptation

Mexico City is famous for its museums, food and culture, but also for its traffic jams. The city has a population of close to 22 million people and more than 6 million cars, and two-hour daily commutes to school or work are the rule for many people. Perhaps because delays are routine, it’s often socially acceptable to be 10 to 15 minutes late to classes or meetings. To tame urban traffic, the computer scientist Carlos Gershenson finds that letting transportation systems adapt and self-organize often works better than trying to predict and control them.

### Shopify 的 A 轮投资 Memo

最近，Bessmer Ventures Partners（BVP）公开了它们非常成功的几个投资案例的投资备忘录，其中包括 Shopify、LinkedIn、Pinterest、Twillio、Yelp 等。而 Shopify 这个项目，是 Alex Ferrara 在 2010 年担任 Bessemer 新合伙人时做的第一个案子，当时他主导了 Bessemer 对 Shopify 的 A 轮投资。比较有挑战的是，Shopify 的 CEO 那时还非常年轻，并且是第一次创业，所以 Alex Ferrara 说他当时非常紧张。如今 10 年过去了，Shopify 已经成为加拿大最有价值的公司。

### 沈南鹏对话郎平：打造冠军之心 | 红杉中国15周年特别出品

投资行业的确是一个“小众行业”，基金公司聚集了一批精英人才。在红杉，我们一直努力践行非常重要的企业文化，叫做合伙人文化，把人才聚拢起来，共同协作完成一份事业。对于红杉来讲，一直葆有“冠军之心”需要处理好两个问题，第一个是变化，第二是传承。投资行业千变万化，如果一家机构的方法是一成不变的，就很难适应新的挑战。我们的组织文化鼓励每个人都要有开放心态，每个人都有巨大的好奇心去探索下一个伟大公司在哪里。关于传承，红杉从 1972 年到 2022 年即将迎来 50 周年，现在是第三代领导班子在领导，我们的使命、愿景、价值观也得到了很好的传承。
