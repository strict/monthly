### 10X Your Career: First Principles For Outsized Success

Finding your own 10x career path requires rigorous decision-making and counterintuitive reasoning. A 10x career is one where you reach escape velocity and become truly high flying — with compounding opportunities for personal growth, societal contributions, and strong financial outcomes. What these people know, that others do not, is that every decision you make along the way should optimize for learning, speed, and network growth — which are all-powerful functions of personal and career growth.

### Why Life Can’t Be Simpler

We’d all like life to be simpler. But we also don’t want to sacrifice our options and capabilities. Tesler’s law of the conservation of complexity, a rule from design, explains why we can’t have both. When we wish for things to be simpler, we usually mean we want products and services to have fewer steps, fewer controls, fewer options, less to learn. But at the same time, we still want all of the same features and capabilities. These two categories of desires are often at odds with each other and distort how we understand the complex.

### Thoughts writing a Google App script

Recently a friend of mine asked for a simple program that would correlate some data drawn from a couple of online services. I decided the best way to do this for him would be to use a google spreadsheet as the host, putting the code into the spreadsheet's script area. I'm no expert in Google App Script, but the exercise led to a few observations, which I feel compelled to share.

### Technical Debt: Why it'll ruin your software

What happened with the Tower of Pisa is a lot like what we understand as Technical Debt. It probably started off as a couple of small mistakes and problems, but the constructors decided to ignore them and build and scale on top of these problems. The tower was built so fast that these little “bugs” in the construction jeopardized the whole structure.

### How Redis Simplifies Microservices Design Patterns

With Redis rapidly becoming a staple across microservice architecture, it’s worth discussing how it can simplify the implementation of design patterns — such as bounded contexts, asynchronous messaging, choreography-based sagas, event-sourcing, CQRS, telemetry, and more.

### Building Netflix’s Distributed Tracing Infrastructure

“@Netflixhelps  Why doesn’t Tiger King play on my phone?” — a Netflix member via Twitter. This is an example of a question our on-call engineers need to answer to help resolve a member issue — which is difficult when troubleshooting distributed systems. Investigating a video streaming failure consists of inspecting all aspects of a member account. In our previous blog post we introduced Edgar, our troubleshooting tool for streaming sessions. Now let’s look at how we designed the tracing infrastructure that powers Edgar.

### 开源富文本编辑器技术的演进

大家公认的富文本编辑器领域在前端里面是天坑的存在，总结下就是存在一个矛盾：落后的生产力与人们日益增长的需求之间的矛盾。尽管标准不完善，但是通过开源还是让编辑器技术得以沉淀和发展，这里我主要从技术实现以及编程思想的演变，介绍编辑器这10年间的变化与发展。

### Rust meets the web - a clash of programming paradigms

Most code running on the web is event-based, garbage-collected, and dynamically typed. In stark contrast, Rust is a compiled language with static type- and memory-safety without a garbage-collector. What are the implications for a project that compiles Rust to WebAssembly? I try to answer this question with a fictive story and hands-on code examples.

### Faster Web App Delivery with PRPL

PRPL is a pattern for structuring and serving web applications and Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) with an emphasis on improved app delivery and launch performance. The letters describe a set of ordered steps for fast, reliable, efficient loading.

### How Facebook is bringing QUIC to billions

We are replacing the de facto protocol the internet has used for decades with QUIC, the latest and most radical step we’ve taken to optimize our network protocols to create a better experience for people on our services. Today, more than 75 percent of our internet traffic uses QUIC and HTTP/3 (we refer to QUIC and HTTP/3 together as QUIC). QUIC has shown significant improvements in several metrics, including request errors, tail latency, response header size, and numerous others that meaningfully affect the experience of people using our apps.

### Full-Bleed Layout Using CSS Grid

Back in the day, there was a gold-standard website layout that everyone strived to create, but that was notoriously difficult to get right: the Holy Grail layout. As the web has evolved, I've discovered a new aspirational layout. It offers a fantastic user experience, especially for long-form text content like news articles or documentation. But, like its predecessor, it's been deceptively hard to achieve; most implementations require obscure hacks or counterintuitive tricks. I recently discovered an elegant solution to this problem using CSS Grid. In this post, we'll learn how it works!

### Linearly Scale font-size with CSS clamp() Based on the Viewport

Responsive typography has been tried in the past with a slew of methods such as media queries and CSS calc(). Here, we’re going to explore a different way to linearly scale text between a set of minimum and maximum sizes as the viewport’s width increases, with the intent of making its behavior at different screen sizes more predictable — All in a single line of CSS, thanks to clamp().

### Computer Scientists Break Traveling Salesperson Record

When Nathan Klein started graduate school two years ago, his advisers proposed a modest plan: to work together on one of the most famous, long-standing problems in theoretical computer science. Even if they didn’t manage to solve it, they figured, Klein would learn a lot in the process. He went along with the idea. “I didn’t know to be intimidated,” he said. “I was just a first-year grad student — I don’t know what’s going on.” Now, in a paper posted online in July, Klein and his advisers at the University of Washington, Anna Karlin and Shayan Oveis Gharan, have finally achieved a goal computer scientists have pursued for nearly half a century: a better way to find approximate solutions to the traveling salesperson problem.

### How we built a $1m ARR SaaS startup

Canny recently hit a major revenue milestone: one million dollars in annual recurring revenue. It feels pretty surreal. When you start a SaaS company, $1m ARR seems impossibly far away. Now that we’re here, it feels very much like a turning point. Like a major chapter has ended, but another one has begun. It’s a perfect moment to reflect. What went well? What could have gone better? What have we learned? These are questions that we’ve been pondering over the last month, and I’m excited to share our learnings with you in this post.

### 创业的本质到底是什么

2012 年的时候，第一次读到 Paul Graham 的 “startup=growth”这篇文章并做了一下翻译，当时有一种醍醐灌顶的感觉，如今再读此文，这样的感觉仍然非常强烈。虽然这一两年来，大家都在谈要回到商业的本质：赚钱。但创业的本质，我认为还是如 Paul Graham 所说：增长。也就是他这篇文章的主题 startup=growth。

### Shopify 如何从工具到平台再到生态

Product Habits Blog 几年前写过一篇长文，分析了 Shopify 完整的成长经历，以及如何一步一步从工具到平台再到生态的过程。其中让我感受很深的一点是，面对市场的每一次巨大变化，创始人 Lütke 都抓住了机会，正如他自己所说：拥抱外部变化是公司的核心价值，并推动他们不断创新。除此之外，Lütke 一直坚持让产品、公司的目标与客户的目标一致，通过帮助客户成功来实现自己的成功

### 内在游戏

提摩西·加尔韦认为，网球场上同时存在着两种类型的比赛：一种是外在的，对抗外部对手带来的障碍，以一种或多种外在奖励为目标；另一种是内在的，要克服内在的心理和情绪障碍，目标是了解和展现一个人真正的潜力。我们需要认识到，内在和外在的比赛是同步进行的，这两种比赛并不是二选一，而是要考虑应该重视哪方面。熟悉我文字的朋友都知道，我经常会用一个乘法来描述这件事：结果 = 能力 X 状态。无论是运动比赛，工作，还是写文章，乃至生活中的很多事情，如果去看结果的话，都有两部分组成。一部分是我们的能力，另一部分则是状态，是我们是否能够克服心理和情绪的影响，全情投入的把我们的能力发挥出来。
