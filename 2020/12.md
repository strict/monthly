# 技术月刊 | 2020.12 - Why Figma Wins

### Why Figma Wins

Companies are a sequencing of loops. While it’s possible to stumble into an initial core loop that works, the companies that are successful in the long term are the ones that can repeatedly find the next loop. However, this evolution is poorly understood relative to its existential impact on a company’s trajectory. Figma is a prime example of sequencing loops. They’re now widely viewed as successful, but the key factors in their success and what bets they must make to get to the next level are less widely understood.

### Lessons from Amazon: ‘Mock Press Release’ Discipline to Sell an Idea

Instead of PowerPoint presentations, Amazon uses a narrative format called the ‘Mock Press Release.’ According to this disciplined approach, for every new feature, product, or service that employees intend to pitch within their divisions, they must produce a press release-style document wherein a hypothetical Amazon customer would first learn about the feature. Amazon contends that if something isn’t interesting enough for a customer and can’t be eloquently expressed in a mock press release format, Amazon probably shouldn’t invest in the idea.

### Data Mesh Principles and Logical Architecture

Our aspiration to augment and improve every aspect of business and life with data, demands a paradigm shift in how we manage data at scale. While the technology advances of the past decade have addressed the scale of volume of data and data processing compute, they have failed to address scale in other dimensions: changes in the data landscape, proliferation of sources of data, diversity of data use cases and users, and speed of response to change. Data mesh addresses these dimensions, founded in four principles: domain-oriented decentralized data ownership and architecture, data as a product, self-serve data infrastructure as a platform, and federated computational governance. Each principle drives a new logical view of the technical architecture and organizational structure.

### KISS, SOLID, YAGNI And Other Fun Acronyms

I’ve been working in the Software Development industry for over 17 years and I’ve seen my share of acronyms fly by, some of them making more sense than others, some of them forming funnier words than others. But let’s face it, as developers, we like our acronyms, we have some regular ones such as MVP and PoC that really sound like whoever created them made no real effort. And then we have others such as SOLID, DRY and KISS that well, lend themselves to some funny interactions.

### Architecture Playbook

Smart people have been thinking on how to create IT architectures as long as there has been computers. Ideas come and go, however creating a good architectures can still be complex and time consuming. Especially when you try to invent the wheel for yourself. With this interactive playbook you can create your IT architecture better and faster.

### The Software Rewrite

A Big Ball of Mud continues to cause suffering because rewriting it is daunting and because stories of failed rewrites abound. If the suffering reaches the point where everyone finds it intolerable, the question of whether to rewrite the software finally arises. This article discusses

- how to reduce the risk of eventually having to rewrite your software;
- if you are considering a rewrite, the prerequisites for embarking on one; and
- once you've decided to rewrite, how to improve your chances of success.

### Good Architecture: Data Model vs. Data Flow

Most architectural mistakes I’ve seen in software stem from a mistake either in the domain model or the data flow. Understanding what each of those two things is, how to do them both well, and how to balance the tensions between them is an essential skill every developer should invest in.

### 14W 行代码量的前端页面长什么样

腾讯文档列表页在不久前经历了一次完全重构后，首屏速度其实已经是不错。但是我们仍然可以引入 SSR 来进一步加快速度。这篇文章就是用来记录和整理我最近实现 SSR 遇到的一些问题和思考。虽然其中有一些基础设施可能和腾讯或文档强相关，但是作为一篇涉及 Node、React 组件、性能、网络、docker 镜像 、云上部署、灰度和发布等内容的文章，仍然可以小小地作为参考或者相似需求的 Checklist。

### The Import On Interaction Pattern

Your page may contain code or data for a component or resource that isn’t immediately necessary. Loading these resources eagerly (i.e right away) can block the main thread if they are costly, pushing out how soon a user can interact with more critical parts of a page. This can impact interaction readiness metrics like First Input Delay, Total Blocking Time and Time to Interactive. Instead of loading these resources immediately, you can load them at a more opportune moment.

### The mythical “fast” web page

How you approach measuring a web page’s performance can tell you whether it’s built for speed or whether it feels fast. We call them lab and field tools. Lab tools are the microscopes that inspect a page for all possible points of friction. Field tools are the binoculars that give you an overview of how users are experiencing the page.

### 10 Insights from Adopting TypeScript at Scale

Bloomberg already had a colossal investment in JavaScript before TypeScript even existed – more than 50 million lines of JS code. Our main product is the Bloomberg Terminal, which contains more than 10,000 apps. The variety of apps is huge, ranging from the display of intensive real-time financial data and news to interactive trading solutions and many forms of messaging. Back in 2005, the company started migrating those apps from Fortran and C/C++ to server-side JavaScript, with client-side JavaScript arriving around 2012. Today, we have more than 2,000 software engineers at the company writing JavaScript. Transitioning this scale of codebase from plain JavaScript to TypeScript is a big deal. So we worked hard to ensure there was a thoughtful process that would keep us aligned with standards and preserve our existing capabilities to evolve and deploy our code quickly and safely.

### Chasing the Pixel-Perfect Dream

I hear this concern a lot; even after years of experience, many front-end developers struggle to perfectly reproduce a design. When designers hand us a completed mockup, they're trusting us to faithfully implement their vision. Their work is funnelled through our implementation, and they're keeping their fingers crossed that we don't mangle it too much in the process.

### Sick of the stupid jokes? Write your own arbitrary-precision JavaScript math library

Javascript has its fair share of ‘wat’ moments. Even though most of them have a logical explanation once you dig in, they can still be surprising. But JavaScript doesn’t deserve all the indignant laughter. For example, you’ll sometimes see jokes like this: In what language does 0.1 + 0.2 not equal 0.3? In JavaScript! Hahahaha. What a stupid language.

### 跨界设计 | 沉浸式新媒体

2012年，Random International的作品《雨屋》正式开启了大众对沉浸式体验的认识，近年随着 TeamLab、Punchdrunk 等互动体验展演的火爆，沉浸式新媒体设计不仅成为了炙手可热的包装概念，同时也透露出人们对于新型互动的好奇心与强需求。提起新媒体作品，我们通常会自动联想到黑科技和脑洞，却容易忽视这些作品除了具有前卫的艺术性表征，同时也暗含着严谨而延展的设计内核。

### Introduction to Speculative Design Practice

From the modernist perspective, design has been primarily regarded as a problem-solving practice, usually dealing with problems detected by other professions. In this sense, the mission of design is closely linked to the needs of the industry or, in a broader sense, the creation of a better living standard. From such modernist perspective, design is seen as a service activity that primarily addresses clients’ needs. However, as graphic designer and publicist Dejan Kršić points out, design has always been a signifying practice that generates, analyses, distributes, mediates and reproduces social meaning, especially nowadays, in the context of the new social, technological, media and economic conditions.

### To Boldly Go Where No Internet Protocol Has Gone Before

Space exploration is hard, not least because of how difficult it is to communicate. Astronauts need to talk to mission control, ideally by video communication, and space vehicles need to send back data they gather, preferably at high speed and with little delay as possible. At first, space missions designed and carried their own distinct communications systems; that worked well enough, but it wasn’t exactly a paragon of efficiency. Then one day in 1998, the internet pioneer Vinton Cerf imagined a network that could offer a richer capacity to serve the growing number of people and vehicles in space. The dream of an interplanetary internet was born.

### 创始人该问投资人什么问题

在融资过程中，创始人和投资人之间很多时候并不是平等的，更多时候投资人处于主导地位，投资人可能把创始人和其公司问（调查）了个遍，最后也不一定会投资。虽然不是每个创始人都有机会与潜在的投资人深入交谈（很多时候你只需要把钱弄到手），但当你有机会从看似平等的投资人中选择时，投资机构 Alpha Bridge 的联合创始人 Jake Chapman 认为，你可以问这 11 个问题。

### 对话投资人刘芹：认知不够，才不敢做疯狂的事

刘芹入行做投资那一年，正值中国互联网行业开端。1999 年 1 月，雷军投资的卓越网上线、2 月马化腾发布 OICQ、4 月马云创办阿里巴巴、9 月王志东就任新浪 CEO。21 年后，互联网公司从无人在意的边缘角色，成长为整个中国经济最具活力的部分。甚至，它们成了连接中国经济的血脉，加速了方方面面的变革。这样惊人的成长因为技术进步，因为一代企业家的创业精神，也因为风险资本的推动。风险资本让一群有梦想有能力，但没有背景的人，有更多的机会创业成功。
